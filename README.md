### Flashing Image
The BTT Pi uses the same images as the BBT CB1 compute module. You can follow instructions for installing it.

BTT has 2 versions of the Kernal. A Minimal image and a Klipper image. The Klipper image has Klipper, Mainsail, Crowsnest and most other dependencies pre-installed. They just need to be updated after.
Images: https://github.com/bigtreetech/CB1/releases

By Default the host name for the image will be "btt-cb1" and it can be accessed with "btt-cb1.local" if you don't know the IP Address for it yet.

## Misc References and Recommended Mods/Prints

### Cable Management Tracks
These are printable versions of the tracks that LDO and other kits include.
I recomend printing them in PETG or a similar material that can flex a bit before snapping. I tried printing them in sever ABSs including Fusion Deep Water blue and the guide fingers were very brittle.
