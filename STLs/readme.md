# BTT PI
The BTT Pi has a different screw footprint than a standard Pi.

There are numerous DIN Cleat mounts for this.
This is from user RoCry on Printables: https://www.printables.com/model/476190-btt-bigtreetech-pi-mount

# Kirigami
The Kirigami frame from Formbot is a bit thicker (~2.5mm) than other frames. As such the frame won't fit into some of the standard Kirigami pieces. Specifically the Stealth version of the Nut Block and the V0.2 Chain Mount.
